iii</span>PREFATORY REMARKS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> placing before my fellow
parishioners this publication, I think it necessary most
distinctly to disavow any personal hostility to the Vicar, as an
individual.</p>
<p>I feel it the more incumbent on me to say this, as my object
is not so much to prove the errors and unscriptural teaching of
the &ldquo;Tractarians,&rdquo; as to make it plain (by his own
words and actions) that Dr. Irons must be considered as
altogether identified with the &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo;
party.</p>
<p>On a fitting occasion, however, I shall be ready (the Lord
enabling me) to shew, that the principles and practices of those
clergymen who have unhappily embraced &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo;
error, are as contrary to God&rsquo;s blessed Word as they are to
the Articles of our Church; and that these principles (if
honestly carried out) as necessarily lead to Rome, as a humble
and prayerful study of the Bible, will assuredly lead the sincere
enquirer into the light and liberty of Gospel truth.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the more wily amongst the
&ldquo;Tractarians&rdquo; to keep aloof in some measure from the
&ldquo;Ultras&rdquo; of their party, and to follow the Jesuitical
advice given from a certain quarter, not to be over hasty in
bringing in Anglican forms and observances amongst their
congregations, but to win them over by little and little.</p>
<p>This policy will account for much that is going on in our
parish, where we have a Vicar who <i>says</i> that he is not a
Tractarian &ldquo;in any sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel assured that the parishioners of Brompton are not
prepared for that open and undisguised
&ldquo;Tractarianism&rdquo; practised in some of our churches;
but when I bear in mind the fact, that during the past year two
or three of the most noted amongst the &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo;
Clergy have been preaching in the Parish Church, it shews the
necessity of being on our guard to resist the insidious attempts
<a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>made from
within, as well as the endeavours now making from without, to
bring us into the bondage of &ldquo;Tractarianism,&rdquo; or into
the more open and unadulterated principles and practices of
Romanism.&nbsp; It may be well for us to remember that at the
recent opening of the Popish Institution (the Oratory) in our
Parish, there were reported as being present twelve Romish
priests or laymen, who until the last few years were clergymen of
the Established Church, and belonging to the
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; party.</p>
<p>In making use of the word &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; a necessity
has been laid upon me, for though I deprecate the use of party
names, I know of no other term (not even Puseyism) that would so
distinctly point out the principles which have led to such
melancholy results to the Church of England.</p>
<p>We must not however suppose these principles are in themselves
<i>new</i>; they are as old as the earliest ages of
Christianity.&nbsp; The Galatian Converts were seduced from the
simplicity of the Gospel by them; and coming down to the days of
Charles the First, our own Church has great cause to lament the
progress they made at that unhappy period.</p>
<p>I am the more solicitous that this should not be lost sight
of, as Dr. Irons says his own views &ldquo;were not obtained from
the Oxford Tracts.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is very possible, but has
nothing to do with the fact, that the Reverend Doctor holds
substantially all the errors of the
&ldquo;Tractarians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the principles of sound Protestanism still prevailing in
this neighbourhood, combined with the faithful preaching of the
gospel in many of our churches and chapels, may by God&rsquo;s
blessing be an effectual bulwark against the covert, as well as
against the open, enemies of our time-honoured Church, is my
earnest prayer.</p>

<p>19, <i>Alfred Place West</i>, <i>Brompton</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11<i>th</i>
<i>December</i>, 1854.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>IS THE
VICAR OF BROMPTON<br />
A TRACTARIAN?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a letter bearing the signature
of the Reverend Dr. Irons, which appeared some time ago in the
&ldquo;Record,&rdquo; there is a distinct denial on the part of
the Reverend Doctor as to his being a
&ldquo;Tractarian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In making a few comments upon the letter alluded to, I feel
that I am not overstepping my duty as a parishioner of Brompton,
and much more my duty as a professed lover of Scriptural truth,
in opposition to Romish and Romanizing error.</p>
<p>Dr. Irons says, in the letter alluded to, &ldquo;I am not a
Tractarian in any sense,&rdquo; and adds, &ldquo;that he has
always differed from the teaching of some of the Oxford
Tracts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the English language is to be understood in its plain
grammatical sense, <i>some</i> refers to a few, or the smaller
portion, and, consequently, Doctor Irons <i>does not</i> differ
from the teaching of the Tracts, generally.</p>
<p>I have never met a &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; who did not
profess to be at issue with one or more of the ninety Tracts; and
I have no doubt but Dr. Pusey himself would unhesitatingly
affirm, that there was teaching in <i>some</i> of them from which
even he dissented.</p>
<p>Could we have asked the reverend gentlemen who have lately
apostatized to Rome from one of the churches at Stoke Newington,
I can easily imagine that they too would have differed from the
teaching of <i>some</i> of the Tracts, though their principles
and practices, before they finally left the Church of England,
were daily giving evidence how completely (as a whole) they were
identified with the party.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that from the time this
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; blight came over our Church, it has been
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the practice
of its clerical adherents to deny any affinity with Romish error,
and to beguile their congregations with the assurance, that the
holding of &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; principles was the best
safeguard to the Church of England.</p>
<p>Not only did their most talented men write and preach in this
strain, but the literary organs of the party still say so; and
when, from time to time, the more honest among them secede to
Rome, their friends attribute their apostacy to any cause but the
right one, sometimes laying the blame upon the evangelical party
for protesting against their unsound and unscriptural
teaching.</p>
<p>Dr. Irons, in the letter referred to, defends himself from the
charge of refusing to sign the Anti-Papal Petition in
1850:&mdash;the charge, however, is neither (as the Doctor calls
it) &ldquo;practically unjust, or untrue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Irons <i>did</i> refuse to sign the Petition, and the
reason given at the time for this refusal was, <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&mdash;that a &ldquo;rider&rdquo; was
added to it (by a vote at the public meeting); &ldquo;that the
Romanizing principles and practices of a portion of the clergy
had encouraged the Pope to act as he had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not here necessary to prove that the &ldquo;rider&rdquo;
enunciated a fact; it is sufficient to shew that Dr. Irons
refused to sign the Petition, and to state the reasons he gave
for that refusal; and then to leave it to the unbiased judgment
of his parishioners to decide between his actions, and the
paragraph in the letter, which says, &ldquo;I am not a Tractarian
in any sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Irons refers to the &lsquo;<i>Morning Post</i>&rsquo; and
other papers for his sentiments as expressed on the occasion of
the meeting.&nbsp; I was present at the meeting, and paid some
attention to the speech of the Reverend Doctor.</p>
<p>I do not deny but there was indignation expressed against the
&ldquo;aggression,&rdquo; but this indignation went very little
beyond what might have been said, and what was actually said, by
sincere Romanists, ere the glorious reformation of the sixteenth
century had shone upon our country.</p>
<p>Our forefathers of that period felt the galling chain of <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>ecclesiastical
and civil oppression laid upon them by the Papacy, but the light
of gospel truth had not penetrated their hearts, and, therefore,
in their opposition to Rome they made no protest against her
soul-destroying doctrines.</p>
<p>The speech of Dr. Irons certainly amounted to something more
than what took place in Scotland, where one of the Bishops of the
<i>Scotch</i> Episcopal Church signed a protest against the
aggression, &ldquo;because it was contrary to Ecclesiastical
order that one bishop should intrude into the diocese of
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In referring to the &lsquo;<i>Morning Post</i>,&rsquo; as
giving the speech of Dr. Irons at the public meeting, it must be
remembered that the &lsquo;<i>Post</i>&rsquo; was then (if not
now) an organ of the &ldquo;Tractarians,&rdquo; and that the
tactics of the party it represented were to hoodwink us, and
under cover of a zeal for &ldquo;Church principles&rdquo; to
disseminate Anti-Protestant views.</p>
<p>I respect the liberty of the Press, and would not willingly
give up its great advantages, but I bear in mind that it would be
about as preposterous to expect from the columns of a
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; periodical any thing favourable to sound
Protestanism, as it would be to look for a true exposition of
constitutional principles in civil government from the pen of the
Russian Autocrat.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable features in the Anti-Papal
demonstration in the autumn of 1850, was the part acted by a
portion of the &ldquo;Tractarians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensible that their party were more than suspected of being
the origin of the &ldquo;Aggression,&rdquo; they were generally
very early in the field to hold meetings, and to display an
<i>apparent</i> opposition to Rome; but if we take the trouble to
look into their proceedings at these meetings, we shall find that
their principal aim was to get credit for zeal against Popery,
and thus to blind the people to their own Romish practices, and
prevent (as far as they could) anything like a real expression of
Protestant feeling on the occasion.</p>
<p>As to the fact that two of the most noted
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; clergymen in London were lately invited
to preach in the Parish Church, Dr. Irons says, they were his
friends; &ldquo;one of them a very old one;&rdquo; but if the
Doctor is not a Tractarian &ldquo;in any sense,&rdquo; he might
have shewn hospitality <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and kindness under his own roof,
rather than give these gentlemen the opportunity of propagating
the errors of their principles and party in the pulpit of the
Parish Church.&nbsp; More recently, a third well known
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; Clergyman was advertised to preach in
Dr. Irons&rsquo; pulpit.</p>
<p>There is an old homely proverb, &ldquo;Shew me the company a
man keeps, and I will tell you what sort of a man he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus commented upon the communication of Dr. Irons in
the &ldquo;Record,&rdquo; I would place before my fellow
parishioners copies of some letters which passed between the
Reverend Doctor and myself several years ago.&nbsp; My object in
doing this is not to say harsh things against the individual, but
to demonstrate that the Doctor is by his own admission a
&ldquo;Tractarian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not presume to sit in judgment on Dr. Irons, though I
should think more highly of his candour and consistency, if he
did not deny the holding of those opinions which I am constrained
to believe he does entertain.</p>
<p>I am no admirer of a certain bishop in the West of England,
but we must do him the justice to acknowledge that he is an
exception to many of his &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; brethren.</p>
<p>There is no faltering on his part as to what his principles
really are, and though we differ from him entirely, we recognize
that we have a plain-spoken Englishman to deal with, who would
feel it beneath his dignity to deny that he does not heartily
side with the &ldquo;Tractarians,&rdquo; and endeavour by every
means to advance their views and opinions.</p>
<p>Lamentable to the Church of England as are the proceedings of
this dignitary, we should not think the more highly of him were
he to assert that he is not a Tractarian &ldquo;in any
sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four following letters passed between Dr. Irons and myself
soon after the public meeting relative to the Papal Aggression in
1850. <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"

<p style="text-align: right"><a name="page9"></a><span

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Meeting of the 15th November, one of the
speakers alluded to the fact, that of the many clergymen, who had
apostatized to Rome, all, or nearly all, were from the
&lsquo;Tractarian,&rsquo; or High Church party, whilst few or
none were from that section of the Church, usually known as the
Evangelical, or Low Church party.&nbsp; You replied (or remarked)
to the statement, &lsquo;Six of one, and half-a-dozen of the
other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not, sir, become me to attribute to you, the
Chairman of the Meeting, an intentional misrepresentation; but I
may be permitted respectfully to remark that your assertion is
entirely at variance with clear and well established facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very possible that amongst the Perverts, some
three or four once belonged to the Evangelical party, but in
every case these clergymen had embraced High Church or Tractarian
principles, before they finally joined the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apologizing for troubling you with this
communication.</p>

&ldquo;<i>December</i>, 3<i>rd</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your note needs no apology&mdash;I believe the facts of
these unhappy secessions to Rome, to be far more fatal to the
Evangelical party, than I at all implied.&nbsp; I am not able to
give you a list of the ascertainable and presentable names of
Converts, though I am anxious to get it.&nbsp; My belief is, that
a very large majority had received a very unsound religious
education among the Low Church people (and some among
Dissenters), and embraced Popery, in consequence of having no
thorough hold on the principles of their own Church.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Whether in their progress towards Popery, they
travelled through our territory as travellers, and not as
dwellers, or natives, does not seem very important to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that some have gone straight from a Dissenting
Chapel to Popery; one case in particular has been brought to my
notice; but I do not wish to cast stones at others, on account of
these things.&nbsp; I only said what I did, in consequence of the
accidental remark of the speaker, and if I annoyed you, I am
sorry for it.</p>

(Signed) &ldquo;WILLIAM J. IRONS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <span class="smcap">Arthur Ellis</span>, Esq.,
R.N.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&nbsp; Mr. Sibthorp was a very low Churchman, Mr.
Newman was brought up an Evangelical, and Mr. Pownall&rsquo;s
son, and Mr. Capes.&nbsp; If I get a list I will send it to
you.&nbsp; Mr. Capes preached very strongly in my former
neighbourhood against High Churchmen, and I said at the time, it
is he that is in danger of Popery, and not I.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;19, <i>Alfred Place
West</i>,<br />
&ldquo;12<i>th</i> <i>December</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been favoured with your note of the 3rd instant,
to which I should have replied before this time, had I not waited
for the list mentioned in your postscript.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As this list does not appear to be forthcoming, I am
the more confirmed in the conviction expressed in my former
communication, that your statement at the Meeting is altogether
at variance with clear and well established facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead, however, of bringing forward proof as to the
correctness of your remark, you are pleased to take a step in
advance, and to express your belief, that a very large majority
of the clergymen, (not a mere &lsquo;six of one and half-a-dozen
of the other,&rsquo;) who have gone over to Rome, received their
religious education &lsquo;among the Low Church
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, sir, presume to question what you believe: <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>all I ask
for, is something in the shape of satisfactory evidence, that
your belief has any better foundation to rest upon, than that of
Dr. Pusey, who believes that the Protestant Church of England,
and the Apostate Church of Rome, &lsquo;are almost identical in
their views on the doctrines of original sin and
justification.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your opinion as to the effect of Evangelical
teaching, had any foundation in fact, how comes it to pass, that
the Perverts to Rome, whether from the clergy or laity, are in
almost every case, from &lsquo;Tractarian&rsquo;
congregations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not, sir, received a University education, nor
does it require the mathematical powers of a senior wrangler to
discover, that if your premises are correct, the friends and
apologists of Romish error would be found not in
&lsquo;Tractarian&rsquo; Churches, but in the congregations of
St. Saviour&rsquo;s and Park Chapel, where from Sabbath to
Sabbath, the blessed truths of the Gospel are preached, in all
their Evangelical fulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may very well leave it to my Dissenting neighbours to
answer for themselves, if they feel inclined to do so; but I may
be permitted to remark, that if your belief has any foundation to
rest upon, the principles you imbibed at Oxford, may not, in the
opinion of your &lsquo;Tractarian&rsquo; friends, be considered a
sufficient guard to counteract that Evangelical teaching, which I
believe it was your privilege to partake of in your earlier years
<a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> and that consequently (reasoning in
your own belief), your present position is not free from danger:
as you must be looked upon rather as a &lsquo;traveller&rsquo;
pursuing your onward course to Rome, than as a
&lsquo;native&rsquo; or &lsquo;dweller.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg leave to attach hereto the opinion of Cardinal
Wiseman, as expressed several years ago, ere
&lsquo;Tractarian&rsquo; buds had in so many instances opened out
into Romish flowers.&nbsp; The Cardinal does not say one word as
to his expectations from the Evangelical party; his hopes are
built on Oxford, and on those &lsquo;to whom our Saints, our
Popes, are become very dear, and in whose eyes our rites, our
ceremonies, nay our very Rubrics are precious.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;You are kind enough to say you are sorry if you
have annoyed me by your observation at the Meeting.&nbsp; I
assure you I was not annoyed; I certainly felt pain and sorrow,
similar to what I experienced when I read the statement of Dr.
Pusey before referred to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believed there was no foundation for either of the
statements, and I thought I saw in both of them the fatal effects
of that teaching, and those principles which led the present
Romish Priest at Islington, to claim the right, whilst
officiating as a minister of the Protestant Church of England,
&lsquo;to hold all Romish doctrine, so long as he did not teach
it from the pulpit;&rsquo; and which led another individual of
the &lsquo;Tractarian&rsquo; party to defend the lawfulness of
subscribing to the articles and formularies of our Church, in a
&lsquo;non-natural sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My paper reminds me I must draw this letter to a
conclusion, and in doing so, I earnestly pray, sir, that Our
Heavenly Father may enlighten your understanding, dispel from
your mind all error and prejudice, and lead you by the teaching
of His Holy Spirit, to retrace your steps from the perilous
position you now occupy, amidst the shifting sands of
&lsquo;Church Principles,&rsquo; until you find yourself in
safety in the impregnable fortress of Bible Truth, and of that
article of our church, which so truly says, &lsquo;Holy Scripture
containeth all things necessary for salvation, so that whatsoever
is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be

<p>The opinion of Cardinal Wiseman referred to in my letter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It seems impossible to read the works of
the Oxford divines, and especially to follow them chronologically
without discovering a daily approach towards our Holy Church,
both in doctrine and in affectionate feeling.&nbsp; Our Saints,
our Popes, have become dear to them by little and little; our
rites and ceremonies, our offices, <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>nay, our very rubrics are precious in
their eyes, far alas, beyond what many of us consider them.&nbsp;
Our monastic institutions, our charitable and educational
provisions, have become more and more objects with them of
earnest study; and every thing in fine, that concerns our
religion, deeply interests their attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really wish to believe that all Converts to
Rome, or most of them, come from the ranks of &lsquo;the
Tractarians&rsquo; I cannot help it.&nbsp; I can only assure you
it is contrary to all my experience.&nbsp; In every case which
has come under my notice for the last ten years, there is proof
of the truth of what I said in my former note; but I did not, and
do not, like to bring a railing accusation against my Evangelical
brethren, else I would, as you find, have said, that my
experience was quite against the assertion now commonly
made.&nbsp; I supposed, however, that other persons had had a
different experience from my own, and I charitably allowed
&lsquo;Six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.&rsquo;&nbsp; For
myself I can only say, that though I should like to know well
enough how the case stands, I should attach no importance to the
fact, if the balance of advantage were a trifle on one side or
other; much less would I think of writing to you in an
uncourteous or uncharitable tone about it.&nbsp; The extract from
Wiseman which you kindly sent me, I easily understand.&nbsp; He,
Jesuit like, wishes to damage High Churchmen, because he knows
that ours is the only strong ground against Rome; <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a> just as in the days of Queen Elizabeth,
Jesuits preached Calvinism as Evangelical Ministers and
Dissenters, on purpose to divide and destroy Churchmen and their
principles.&nbsp; Dr. Wiseman never abuses Low Churchmen.&nbsp;
But may I request, that as I have not time <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>for letters
on such small points, you rather would, (if you desire it,) call
on me any morning you please, and in a Christian and gentle
spirit, converse on any important topic which you may desire to
discuss.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I am, faithfully yours,<br />
(Signed) &ldquo;WILLIAM. J. IRONS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <span class="smcap">Arthur Ellis</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq</span>., R.N.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the foregoing Correspondence between Dr. <span
class="smcap">Irons</span> and myself it will be seen, that I
addressed him under the conviction that he was one with the
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; party, and that his statement about
&ldquo;six of one and half-a-dozen of the other,&rdquo; was
offered as a kind of defence of his friends.</p>
<p>In the answers of Dr. <span class="smcap">Irons</span> to my
communications, it is quite evident, that he never thought of
denying his identity with the &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; party; the
tenor of his letters is not to shew that he is not a Tractarian
&ldquo;in any sense,&rdquo; but to defend
&ldquo;Tractarianism&rdquo; from the charge of being the primary
cause of the many secessions to Rome from amongst his clerical
brethren.</p>
<p>Compare the letters of the Rev. Doctor with his more recent
statement of not being a Tractarian &ldquo;in any sense,&rdquo;
and there can be no doubt as to what must be the verdict.</p>
<p>There are, however, some points in both the letters of Dr.
<span class="smcap">Irons</span> to which I would allude more
fully, and comment upon more at length.</p>
<p>The Rev. Doctor states that he is anxious to get a list of the
&ldquo;ascertainable and presentable names of the
Converts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If such a list would have given so formidable an array of
Evangelical Churchmen and Dissenters, I can hardly suppose but
Dr. <span class="smcap">Irons</span> (giving him all credit for
not wishing to cast stones at others), would have procured it,
from the desire to shew me and other of his parishioners, that
the real cause of these perversions was in the &ldquo;unsound
religious education received amongst the &lsquo;Low Church People
and Dissenters,&rsquo;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo;
teaching and principles had nothing to do in the matter.</p>
<p>When Dr. <span class="smcap">Irons</span> can make good his
position by an &ldquo;ascertainable and presentable list,&rdquo;
or by any other evidence equally convincing, I feel assured, that
many who are now under the conviction that
&ldquo;Tractarianism&rdquo; is the Broad Road to Rome, will
acknowledge their error, and confess that they have done the
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; party much injustice.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>In the
second letter of Dr. <span class="smcap">Irons</span> I would
especially draw attention to what he says in reference to the
praise so lavishly bestowed upon the &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo;
party by Cardinal Wiseman.</p>
<p>The question, be it remembered, is not as to the honesty of
the motives which led the Cardinal to bestow such eulogiums on
his Oxford friends.</p>
<p>It is a much more simple question and much more easy of
satisfactory proof.</p>
<p>Is the Cardinal&rsquo;s opinion of &ldquo;Tractarians&rdquo;
warranted by facts?</p>
<p>Let the names of Wilberforce, Manning, Thynne, Haskell,
Allies, and a host of others, now Priests of the Church of Rome,
give the answer.</p>
<p>We must not lose sight of the fact in dealing with
&ldquo;Tractarians,&rdquo; that just in proportion as they have
received the commendation of Cardinal Wiseman and the Organs of
the Romanists; in like proportion, have all true Protestants been
energetic in the condemnation of their teaching and
principles.</p>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Irons</span> says that Cardinal
Wiseman &ldquo;never abuses Low Churchmen,&rdquo; but he omits to
say (what is much more to the point), that the Cardinal never
<i>praises</i> them.</p>
<p>When Romanists shall praise Low Churchmen and Dissenters, we
may be assured that serious errors are creeping in amongst
them.&nbsp; If friends condemn, we may yet be right.&nbsp; But if
enemies bestow their praises upon us, there can be little doubt
but we are wrong.</p>
<p>I will not attempt to put my knowledge of Church History on a
par with that of Dr. <span class="smcap">Irons</span>.&nbsp; A
life spent on the watery element has precluded me from the
opportunity of being deeply versant on such subjects; but I have
always understood, that in the days of Queen Elizabeth, the
Protestant Ministers of the Church of England were, with few
exceptions, Calvinists: and the idea of a Jesuit pretending to be
a Calvinist and preaching to <i>Dissenters</i> in such a
character in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, appears to me altogether an
imagination of the Reverend Doctor; and must have reference to a
subsequent period, when principles (the exact counterpart of
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo;), had crept into the Church and were
bidding fair to lead the nation back to Rome.</p>
<p>The Puritans of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign were not Dissenters,
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>they had
not then been driven out of the Church.&nbsp; If Elizabeth did
carry a high hand towards them, her conduct was merciful and
humane if put in contrast with the tyranny and oppression they
suffered at a later period, when the Monarchs of the Stuart line
were aided by the bigotry and persecuting principles of
Archbishop Laud and others, whose memories are held in such high
esteem by the &ldquo;Tractarians&rdquo; of the present day.</p>
<p>In endeavouring to ignore the evidence of Cardinal Wiseman in
favour of &ldquo;Tractarianism,&rdquo; Dr. <span
class="smcap">Irons</span> certainly has the example of high
ecclesiastical authority.&nbsp; In a correspondence lately
published between a Bishop of our Church (whose
&ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; leanings are but too evident) and an
esteemed Clergyman; the Bishop takes nearly the same line of
argument (if such tortuous reasoning can be called argument), in
regard to &ldquo;Tractarian&rdquo; publications highly eulogized
by the literary organs of the Romanists.</p>
<p>The Bishop, however, omits to mention, that these
publications, so highly thought of by Papists, are altogether
condemned by every sound Protestant.</p>
<p>In bringing this little publication to a close, I find it has
run out to a length I did not look for when I took up my pen.</p>
<p>I would express a hope that in any thing I may have said of
individuals, I have not given way to unkind or acrimonious
expressions.&nbsp; It is foreign to my feelings to have done so;
and I would desire to remember &ldquo;that the wrath of man
worketh not the righteousness of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far abler pens than mine have already shown forth the true
character of &ldquo;Tractarianism,&rdquo; and unmasked its
semi-popish principles and practices.&nbsp; If, in the object I
had in view (as alluded to at the commencement of my prefatory
remarks), I have said any thing to serve as a warning to my
Protestant friends and neighbours, and to lead them to be more in
earnest in contending for the faith &ldquo;once delivered to the
saints,&rdquo; I have an ample reward.</p>
<p>I now leave the question (Is the Vicar of Brompton a
Tractarian?) to the judgment of those who may take the trouble to
read this Pamphlet.&nbsp; I can truly say, I shall sincerely
rejoice to have it made plain to me that what Dr. <span
class="smcap">Irons</span> says of himself is a true picture, and
that he is not a Tractarian &ldquo;in any sense.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
